Introduction

Cassava, a vital African food source, faces yield-reducing viral diseases. Smallholder farmers urgently need efficient disease identification to ensure food security.

The Challenge

Current visual inspection methods are expensive and not scalable. Our competition tackles this by using data science to classify cassava leaf images, enabling quick disease detection.

Dataset

We provide 21,367 real-world images from Ugandan farms, annotated by experts. This dataset mimics farmers' situations, enhancing accurate disease diagnosis.

Task

Your goal is to create a model categorizing cassava leaves into diseases or healthy states. This aids farmers in timely interventions to protect their crops.

Impact

By merging data science and agriculture, we empower farmers, secure food supplies, and promote sustainable practices across Africa.
